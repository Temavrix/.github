# About Temavrix
Temavrix is a small scale startup that established a base in github to post free, open-source repositories for the world to see. Our aim is to bring an end to many problems both in the computer industry and the real world through open-source projects by innovating and solving problems. We have worked on a very few small-scaled projects so far with a constant hope that we can help the world in a small positive way. While we still have some ongoing and some ambitious projects coming up we will like to ask you to support our startup by simply visiting our github projects and contributing to them by starring and reporting a issue to help fix bugs and mistakes and improve our projects for others.
